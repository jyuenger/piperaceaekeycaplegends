These files fix the sizing and alignment of the original SA KRK legends.

I also include F14-F17 legends that can be mapped to the keys above the 
number pad on 108-key boards, and legends for a 1.5u ergo Escape key, 
and a 1.25u Backspace key. Since KRK doesn't officially support any of those, 
you'll need to manually map them by entering X and Y offset values.
