Tweaked and improved legend files for the Keyboard Render Kit, based on ImperfectLink's originals. 

This isn't meant to rival or replace ImperfectLink's repo. In general, I submit most of my custom legend files there. But in some cases, my files aren't necessarily any better, and don't offer any new legends not already present in his. It's down to my own personal subjective preference towards things like very specific legends, or a slight difference in the font used for rendering, or the text size. 

For things like that, I'm posting the files here in my own repo to make them available to anyone else who may share the same preferences, or to use as a jumping-off point.



## Fonts

For DCS and SA, the font I use is Gorton Perfected. For GMK Cyl, it's Open Cherry.



## DCS Notes

• Alphas are 100% width, default spacing, Regular weight.

• Text mods are 85% width, -75% spacing, Medium weight.

• Capital Q is an alt glyph with a straight tail.

• Lowercase a and g, and £ are custom and hand drawn, to better match the Gorton Modified font used in Signature Plastics's molds.

• In all instances, 3 is taken from the Gotham Rounded font and stretched to the same proportions as the Gorton Perfected 3 digit.



## SA Notes

• Alphas are 100% width, default spacing, Regular weight.

• Text mods are 90% width, default spacing, Medium weight.

• Capital Q is an alt glyph with a straight tail.

• In all instances, 3 is taken from the Gotham Rounded font and stretched to the same proportions as the Gorton Perfected 3 digit.



## GMK Cyl Notes

• I've modified the default Open Cherry kerning by hand on a key by key basis to try to avoid weird gaps like "Shif t".
