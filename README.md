Tweaked and improved legend files for the Keyboard Render Kit, based on ImperfectLink's originals. 

This isn't meant to rival or replace ImperfectLink's repo. In general, I submit most of my custom legend files there. But in some cases, my files aren't necessarily any better, and don't offer any new legends not already present in his. It's down to my own personal subjective preference towards things like very specific legends, or a slight difference in the font used for rendering, or the text size. For things like that, I'm posting the files here in my own repo to make them available to anyone else who may share the same preferences.
