Tweaked and improved legend files for the Keyboard Render Kit, based on ImperfectLink's originals. 

In general, I submit most of my custom legend files to ImperfectLink's repo. But in some cases, my files aren't necessarily any better, or don't offer any new legends not already present. It's just my own personal subjective preference for things like specific legends, or a slight different in the font used for rendering, or embiggened text size. For things like that, I'm posting the files here in my own repo to make them available to anyone else who may share the same preferences.
