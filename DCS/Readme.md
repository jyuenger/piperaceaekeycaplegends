These files fix the sizing and alignment of the original DCS KRK legends.

There's also some personal preferences applied. I tend to use "Compose Character" as an alternate legend for 1.75u R3 Control, as a Wyse easter egg, and also as an OS-neutral key in HHKB layouts. It's so vague, it can be anything, from a VIM modifier key to a Command key on a Mac.

I also include F14-F17 legends that can be mapped to the keys above the number pad on 108-key boards, and legends for a 1.5u ergo Escape key, and a 1.25u Backspace key. Since KRK doesn't officially support those, you'll need to manually map them by entering X and Y offset values.
